## Multi-Container Pods

- Multi-container pods are a design pattern where multiple containers are co-located within the same pod, sharing the same resources and network namespace.
- Containers within a multi-container pod share the same IP address and can communicate with each other via localhost.
- Multi-container pods are useful for cases where containers need to work together closely, such as sidecar pattern, logging, monitoring, or data processing.
- The containers within a pod are typically co-dependent and have a shared lifecycle, meaning they are created, started, and stopped together.
- Each container within a pod has its own responsibilities and can run different processes or services.
- Containers within a pod can communicate through inter-process communication mechanisms like shared volumes or using networking facilities.

## Sidecar Pattern

- The sidecar pattern is a popular multi-container pattern where a secondary container (sidecar) is added to a pod to enhance or extend the functionality of the main container.
- The sidecar container runs alongside the primary container, sharing the same lifecycle and resources.
- Sidecar containers often provide additional capabilities like logging, monitoring, data syncing, or proxying requests.
- The sidecar pattern promotes modularity and separation of concerns by isolating specific functionality into separate containers.

## Adapter Pattern

- The adapter pattern is another type of multi-container pattern in which a separate container (adapter) is added to a pod to adapt or transform data for consumption by the main container.
- The adapter container acts as a mediator between the main container and external systems or data sources.
- It handles data transformation, format conversions, or API integrations to ensure compatibility and seamless communication between the main container and external entities.

## Ambassador Pattern

- The ambassador pattern involves adding an ambassador container to a pod, acting as an intermediary between the main container and external services.
- The ambassador container encapsulates the logic and complexity of connecting to external services, handling authentication, routing, or protocol conversions.
- It allows the main container to interact with external services without having to manage those interactions directly.

## Init-Container Pattern

- While init-containers were mentioned earlier as part of the init-container pods, they can also be considered as a type of multi-container pattern.
- Init-containers are used to perform initialization tasks before the main container starts.
- They can prepare the environment, fetch configuration data, or populate shared volumes that the main container requires.
